# Factorio-Mod-Creator-Studio
##Description
The idea behind the Factorio Mod Creator Studio(FMCS) is to make it as easy as possible to create modifications for the game Factorio without having to learn how to program. Adding new items, technologies, entities etc. can be done by simply filling out forms. For the ones who want to make their mods a bit more complex, the software provides a LUA Editor with syntax highlighting, auto completion in which the [Factorio API](http://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/) is embedded and a pre-written LUA library with functions which use the [Factorio API](http://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/). The software also provides the user with tools for generating sprite sheets and UI elements. And it allows the modder to export his mod and pack it into a ZIP file with a single click.
